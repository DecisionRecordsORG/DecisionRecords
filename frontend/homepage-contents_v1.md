# Architecture Decisions

**Decisions shape systems for years — but the reasons behind them are rarely preserved.**

Anyone tasked with fixing, evolving, regulating, securing, or modernising systems
suffers from that loss of context.

Architecture-Decisions.org is an open initiative to make architectural decisions
explicit, durable, and reusable across IT and organisations.



## What Do We Mean by “Architecture Decisions”?

Architecture decisions are **not limited to software projects**.

Every organisation makes architecture decisions that shape:
- IT landscapes
- Digital platforms
- Infrastructure and cloud strategies
- Security and compliance postures
- Data, integration, and interoperability models
- Products, services, and operating models

These decisions often:
- Span years or decades
- Outlive the people who made them
- Affect cost, risk, resilience, compliance, and innovation
- Are revisited only when something breaks

Yet most of them are **never formally recorded**.

## The Problem: Decisions Without Memory

Across organisations, critical decisions are often:
- Made in meetings, emails, or slide decks
- Justified by temporary constraints or assumptions
- Forgotten once implementation starts

When context is lost:
- New teams cannot understand *why things are the way they are*
- Fixing or modernising systems becomes risky and expensive
- Mistakes are repeated
- Compliance, security, and auditability suffer
- AI systems and automation lack reliable historical context

If you’ve ever been asked to *fix*, *secure*, *modernise*, or *regulate* a system without knowing **why its architecture looks the way it does**, you’ve experienced this problem firsthand.

## Our Core Idea

**Architecture decisions should be treated as first-class records.**

Just like financial records, legal documents, or policies:
- Architecture decisions deserve structure
- They deserve traceability
- They deserve to survive personnel and technology changes

This project promotes the idea that:
> *Well-documented decisions enable better future decisions.*

## About Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

The concept of **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** originated in software engineering — but the principle applies far beyond software.

At its core, an ADR answers:
- What decision was made?
- In what context?
- What alternatives were considered?
- Why was this option chosen?
- What consequences were expected?

This project **extends that thinking** to:
- Enterprise IT architecture
- Digital policy and governance
- Security and compliance decisions
- Cloud, data, and platform strategies
- Operational and organisational design choices

ADRs are a **starting point**, not the limit.

## What This Site Is

Architecture-Decisions.org is an **open, non-profit, community-driven reference platform** for:

- Capturing architecture decisions across domains
- Sharing decision record patterns and templates
- Learning how to document decisions effectively
- Preserving architectural rationale over time
- Supporting transparency, accountability, and learning

This is not a tool vendor.
This is not a framework prescription.
This is a **shared knowledge space**.

## Why This Matters — Especially Now

As systems become:
- More complex
- More interconnected
- More regulated
- More automated and AI-driven

**Lack of decision context becomes a serious risk.**

Future engineers, architects, auditors — and AI systems — should not have to guess *why* a system looks the way it does.

Architecture-Decisions.org exists to make that knowledge explicit.
