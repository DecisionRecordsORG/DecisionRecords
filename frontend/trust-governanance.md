Trust & Governance

Architecture Decisions is an open source, independent initiative.

No single organisation owns or controls the platform.
	•	Users own their data
You retain ownership of all decision records and content you create.
	•	No data sales, no advertising
We do not sell user data, analytics, or insights — now or in the future.
	•	Open source, self-hostable
Run the platform on your own infrastructure or use our managed cloud service.
	•	Neutral by design
The platform is not tied to any vendor, consultancy, framework, or certification scheme.

Our goal is simple:
to provide durable infrastructure for capturing and preserving architectural decisions — without hidden incentives.
